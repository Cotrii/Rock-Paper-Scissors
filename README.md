#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/uz9ercf1N3c
#### Description:

An RPS game made in HTML, CSS & JS. A player or a bot can win once it wins a total of 5 rounds. Have fun!

In this game, you will be facing a bot, and whoever gets first to win five rounds will be the winner of the game. The game will not end until there is a victor, so there is a chance that you can get multiple draws. The game will not end until there is a victor, so there is a chance that you can get multiple draws. If you lose or even draw, the screen shows a neutral face emoji which could mean disappointment or speechlessness that you just lost. If you win, then it shows an excited or happy emoji. On the top right screen, you will see a counter showing the current result for the player, which is me right now, and the bot you are facing on the computer. 

Once the game is done, all buttons will be disabled to indicate that the game is over, and the winner gets displayed on the screen with the final results showing the same emojis.

The code for the terminal version is also there to provide the user with two different experiences, and show what the program looked like before implementing HTML and CSS for the interface.
